There is a lot of UI frameworks available to use for your react project.

`npm i -D tailwindcss postcss-cli autoprefixer@9.8.5`


create postcss config
`touch postcss.config.js`


Create tailwind config
`npx tailwind init`
It will generate a file called tailwind.config.js .You only need to touch this file if you want to customize tailwind
