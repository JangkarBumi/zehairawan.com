- Read the interviews by the founder. Example [Nathan Barry interview in IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/008-nathan-barry-of-convertkit).

1. ConverKit - MailChimp for professional bloggers & creators; ConvertKit is the power of Infusionsoft but easier to use than MailChimp.

2. Buffer - Simpler social media tools for authentic engagement

3. TypeForm - People-friendly forms and surveys
