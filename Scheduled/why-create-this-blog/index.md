## Share what i know
After reading an article about why should i start a blog in (DEV Community)[https://dev.to/], i realized that i don't have to wait until i'm an expert to share what i know. For example sometimes when i'm reading documentation of a framework or a tools that i want to use, i'm having  a hard time understanding it. I had to google for someone's article that has a bare bones example of it and play around with it.


## Record step by step journey
 A few years ago, my mentor and i promoting the same product as an exercise. Short story his campaign is successful and mine barely break even. We both are using the same checklist / principles while creating the landing page and ads copy. When we discussed it he can't explain what he's doing that different. After a few weeks of comparing data we know, it's subtle thing like using their "circle" language and targeting someone who will buy the product as a gift for their relatives instead of directly to the customer. There is bias after you master something to the level of it becomes second nature, it becomes really hard to explain how you do what you do. By writing a blog of my journey at least i can try to minimize it.

 ## Give back
 As i got benefit from reading someone's article, i will try to do the same. Even it's just helping one person, if i can save them some time or help them fix a problem that's enough for me.

 ## Sharpening my writing skills
 I've always struggled with writing article, i can write a few sentences for copywriting without a problem but when it comes to writing article my style feels rigid. At the start for some reason i think writing is built-in talent. Either you can write a good story or you cant. But after listening to a podcast by (James Clear)[https://jamesclear.com/once-per-week] i just decided to write twice a week, no matter how bad is it.
